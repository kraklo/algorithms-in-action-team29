## Exercises/Exploration

Choose Graph 2 and manually delete the edge between nodes 11 and 13,
so the graph has two components.  Find minimum spanning forest of the
resulting graph.

Compare and contrast how Prim's algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm operate
to compute minimum spanning trees.

Consider Graph 1 with weights "As input". There are two different minimal
spanning trees and the current coding finds one of them.  How could the
coding be changed so the other second one is found instead?  Can you 
use the existing code to find the second one by re-numbering the graph nodes?

For Graph1 with the other weight options, can you convince yourself that
there is a single minimum spanning tree?
